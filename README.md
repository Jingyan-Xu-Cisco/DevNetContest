GC-4-Simple-App-For-Network-Topology-Change

# Use Case Description
OT network is a simple and closed network which requires high level of security and resilience. For security reasons, we build our own application to monitor the network healthiness. The application can generate real time OT network topology and also track the network topology history. The application can compare the last good topology with the current one. And if the topology changes, it will trigger a RESTful call to a SMS gateway to notify administrators.
